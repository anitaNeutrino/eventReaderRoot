Introduction
============
This is version 4 of the ANITA Event Reader for ROOT Data and Raw Data, and is the first designed for ANITA II data. At present backwards compatibility is broken this will hoepfully be restored at some point once I work out how to do it. It is meant to be a simple class that will read in the raw event data (in ROOT file or raw psev_ format ) and convert it into UsefulAnitaEvent calibrated objects (the raw data reader actually creates text files of times and voltages).

Notes
======
As of version 2.0 the implementation of the data interface is frozen. If people have comments, complaints or requests they shouldn't hesitate to contact me. 

In AnitaGeomTool and therefore in the rest of the code it should be noted that a 'C' style numbering convention is used. Therefore antennas are numbered 0-31 and phi sectors numbered 0-15. 

As of version 3.2.0 AnitaGeomTool has an interface to Kurt's photogrammetry data.In particular through the following family of functions:
a)  Double_t getAntZ(int ant);    // along with x,y,z,r and phi	
b)  Double_t getAntFaceZ(int ant) // along with x,y,z,r and phi	
The positions of the centre of the antenna face (the numbers from Kurt) are given by the b) family of functions. The a) family of functions return a position 20cm behind the face of the antenna, this position is meant to approximate teh timing centre of the antenna.

The clock calib numbers were derived by looking at Seavey calibration pulses from Willy Field, using baselines given by the locations of the antenna timing centres. Clearly those using their own clock calibrations (namely Andres and Jiwoo) wouldn't want to use this option.
