Introduction
============
This is version 1.0 of the ANITA Event Reader for ROOT. It is meant to be a
simple class that will read in the raw event data (in ROOT format as available
at ) and convert it into UsefulAnitaEvent calibrated objects. 



Compiling dumpEvents
====================
a) Type make

Running dumpEvents
=================
The directory containg libEventReader.so must be in either your system library
path or your own LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For usage instructions run dumpEvents:
Usage: 
        ./dumpEvents <psev filename> <calib type>

Available Calib Types:
        0  --  No Calibration
        1  --  Just Unwrap
        2  --  Raw(ish) ADCs
        3  --  Default Calibration
        4  --  Full Labrador Calibration (from ANITA note 115)
        5  --  Full Labrador Calibration + Measured Cable Delays
        6  --  Jiwoo's Time Calibration (no voltage calibration)
        7  --  Jiwoo's Time Calibration + Measured Cable Delays


Running the root script
=======================
The simple root script will look for a psev file named testFile.dat.gz in the
local directory. Either edit the script to point to a real file or copy/link a
real file to this location. Then type:
root simpleRootExample.C


Notes
======
Version 2.0 is also very rough around the edges. If people have comments,
complaints or requests they shouldn't hesitate to contact me.
